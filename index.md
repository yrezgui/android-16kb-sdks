# Let's get ready for 16 KB
**Android 15** has introduced 16 KB memory page size support but it can be
hard to figure out which popular Gradle dependencies are compatible.
This website list popular libraries and their compatible versions if they exist.

## What's 16 KB?
Historically, Android has managed memory in 4 KB pages. As devices are getting equiped with more RAM, Android has introducing support for a 16 KB memory page size starting with Android 15. This change aims to improve overall system and app performance, including faster app launches, better battery usage, quicker camera starts, and speedier system boot-ups, by reducing the overhead for the OS when managing memory.

While it might lead to a slight increase in average memory usage, the performance gains are expected to outweigh this trade-off, with some apps seeing up to a 30% improvement in launch times under memory pressure.

Moving forward, new apps and updates to existing apps targeting Android 15+ devices submitted to Google Play will be required to support 16 KB page sizes from November 1st, 2025.
